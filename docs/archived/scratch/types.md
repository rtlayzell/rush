## Optional Types

Normally, variables and constants must be initialized as they are declared, or during
the constructor of the class that defines them.  However, it is sometimes desirable to
post-pone initialization and for that we have Optionals.


Declaring Optionals

var x: int?
var str: string?


Accessing the value of an optional:

var y1: int = x!
var y2: int = x.value
