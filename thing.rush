## remove the ability to name tuples and replace with the concept of records.
## tuples are now positional data structures only that may be created and accessed as follows:

let t = (31, "reegan")
let {age, name} = t

## records replace named tuples and differ slightly in syntax.

let r = {
	age = 31,
	name = "reegan",
	properties = {
		prop1 = "value1",
		prop2 = "value2"
	}
}
